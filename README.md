# Assembly-Project-Flappy-Bird
Overview:
A fully self-contained Flappy Bird game implemented in x86 Assembly using NASM, demonstrating advanced assembly programming techniques and retro aesthetics. This project is a testament to the power of low-level programming, featuring dynamic gameplay, multitasking, and text-mode graphics, all without external dependencies.

Key Features:

🚀 Dynamic Gameplay
Procedurally generated pipes and scrolling ground, creating a challenging and engaging experience.
Stars that shift dynamically on the screen, sometimes forming constellations for a visually appealing background.

🛠️ Advanced Assembly Techniques
Utilizes branching, addressing modes, and segment manipulation for optimized memory and control flow.
Leverages interrupts for multitasking, user input handling, and system calls.

🎵 Multitasking with Music
Implements a Process Control Block (PCB) to enable background music that loops infinitely.
Music pauses seamlessly when the ESC key is pressed, with an option to unpause.

🌟 Realistic Physics
Gravity-based delays simulate natural falling motion.
Implements projectile-like motion where the bird momentarily hovers at the peak before falling.

💥 Game Over Mechanics
Upon collision, the bird falls to the ground dramatically, adding a cinematic touch.
Final score is displayed, along with options to restart the game or exit.

🕹️ Retro Visuals
Developed in text mode, delivering a nostalgic aesthetic reminiscent of early computer games.
Minimalist yet immersive graphics designed for clarity and performance.
